and it features built-in syntax highlighting through markdown code blocks.

## Key Features

- Multilingual Execution: Supports Zsh, JavaScript, and Python.
- Simplified Scripting: Use markdown files (.md) to organize and run commands.
- Syntax Highlighting: Leverages markdown code blocks for readability.
